# google-activity-reporter-app
It is an app which monitor google cloud account activity of the users which have access from an organization/admin on a project. It means if you have created a project on
google cloud with name "myProject.com" and you have assigned access to multiple users with assigning/creating a particular emailId(user@myProject.com) for each user on
that project to work and you want to monitor all users activities that what they are doing by using that account e.g a user created a new chatRoom or what he shared in 
groups you have added him etc.

You can simply run this app via following document with name "Integration of Google Workspace Admin Report in Java Spring Boot Project".

There is another document attached in which i explain how to add and grant rights to a new user into a project.
